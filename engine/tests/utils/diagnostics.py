"""Diagnostic helpers for data integrity tests.

When a data integrity assertion fails in CI (but not locally), these
helpers dump enough state to diagnose the root cause from CI logs alone.

Usage::

    sink_data = get_sink_records(collector_name)
    if len(sink_data) != expected:
        dump_data_loss_diagnostics(
            test_name="test_many_small_batches_stress",
            sink_data=sink_data,
            expected_count=expected,
            collector_name=collector_name,
            runner=runner,          # RayJobRunner (broker still alive)
            batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
            id_field="id",
        )
    assert len(sink_data) == expected, ...
