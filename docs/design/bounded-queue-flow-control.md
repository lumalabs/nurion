## 1. Problem Statement

Production failures observed (March 2026):

| Failure | Root Cause | Queue Depth Signal |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| OOM on workers | Unbounded payloads in flight | Queue may be LOW |
| NVMe disk full | Source pushes faster than sink drains | Queue may be LOW |
| Network saturation | Too many concurrent Flight reads | Queue HIGH |
| 500 workers stall | Queue contention (fixed: atomic counters) | Queue ZERO |
| GPU idle | Upstream can't feed GPU fast enough | Queue EMPTY |

**Current backpressure only checks queue depth.** A system can have empty queues
but be about to OOM, or full queues but idle GPUs. Queue depth alone is
insufficient — but monitoring 5 resource dimensions is the wrong fix.

---

## 2. Key Insight: Bound the Queue, Not the Resources

### What battle-tested systems do

| System | Model | Backpressure |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Flink** | Credit-based flow control | Downstream sends credits; upstream blocks without credits |
| **NVIDIA DALI** | Pull-based prefetch | Fixed-depth prefetch buffer; GPU pulls; full buffer = upstream stops |
| **Ray Data** | Bounded buffer | `max_buffered_batches`; producer blocks when buffer full |
| **Spark Streaming** | Rate limiter | Measures throughput, adjusts pull rate |
| **DeepSpeed** | Static schedule | Pipeline micro-batches statically scheduled |

**Common pattern: bounded buffers, not resource monitoring.**

With a bounded queue, all resource problems become self-limiting:

| Resource | Why bounded queue solves it |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Memory | At most `W × P` payloads in flight → predictable RSS |
| NVMe disk | At most `W × P` files on disk → cannot fill disk |
| Network | At most `W × P` concurrent Flight reads → self-limited |
| S3 bandwidth | Sink buffer bounded → write rate bounded |
| GPU utilization | `P` prefetch batches → GPU always has data ready |

**Bounded queues replace five monitoring dimensions.**

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Bounded Inter-Stage Queues

```
Source ──push──▶ [bound_A] ──claim──▶ CPU Transform ──ack_and_scatter──▶ [bound_B] ──▶ GPU ──▶ [bound_C] ──▶ Sink
                  │                                                        │
                  │ blocks when full                                       │ blocks when full
                  ▼                                                        ▼
         (backpressure propagates backward from bottleneck)
```

Each inter-stage QueueGroup has a `max_pending` that limits buffered messages.
Backpressure propagates backward naturally — no global coordinator needed.
The bottleneck stage (usually GPU) sets the pace for the entire pipeline.

**How it works:**
1. Each QueueGroup has `max_pending` (in message count, derived from byte budget)
2. `push()` / `ack_and_scatter()` returns `QueueFull` when `pending >= max_pending`
3. Upstream worker waits and retries → its input queue fills → propagates further
4. Bottleneck stage (GPU) determines steady-state throughput for the entire pipeline

### 3.2 Bound Sizing: Memory Budget, Not Message Count

A workflow has multiple stages with different payload sizes. Count-based bounds
(`W × 3`) don't account for this — 12 messages of 100MB vs 12 messages of 1KB
are very different memory footprints.

**Approach: allocate a node memory budget, divide across stages, convert to
message counts based on observed payload size.**

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowFlowConfig:
    buffer_memory_fraction: float = 0.4
    # Fraction of node memory reserved for pipeline buffers.
    # Remaining 60%: worker RSS, Ray object store, OS, GPU memory.
    # User rarely touches this — default 0.4 works for most workloads.

    min_prefetch: int = 2
    # Minimum messages per downstream worker (prevent GPU starvation).
    # Even if memory budget is tight, each GPU gets ≥2 batches queued.
```

**Calculation at pipeline startup (automatic, no user config per stage):**

```python
def compute_stage_bounds(stages: List[Stage], node_memory_bytes: int,
                         config: WorkflowFlowConfig) -> Dict[str, int]:
    total_budget = int(node_memory_bytes * config.buffer_memory_fraction)
    total_workers = sum(s.max_parallelism for s in stages if s.downstream)

    bounds = {}
    for stage in stages:
        ds = stage.downstream_stage
        if ds is None:
            continue  # sink has no downstream queue

        # Budget proportional to downstream worker count
        stage_budget = total_budget * ds.max_parallelism / total_workers

        # Estimate payload size from batch_size (refined at runtime)
        est_payload = stage.batch_size * 1024  # conservative: 1KB/row

        max_pending = max(
            int(stage_budget / est_payload),
            ds.max_parallelism * config.min_prefetch,  # floor: GPU never starves
        )
        bounds[stage.stage_id] = max_pending
    return bounds
```

**Example: 32GB node, 4 stages**

```
Node memory: 32 GB, buffer_fraction: 0.4 → budget: 12.8 GB
Stages: Source(8w) → Transform(8w) → GPU(4w) → Sink(2w)
total_workers = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14

Stage          | Workers | Budget share | Est payload | max_pending
Source→Trans   | 8       | 7.3 GB       | 100 KB      | 73,000
Transform→GPU  | 4       | 3.7 GB       | 50 MB       | 74
GPU→Sink       | 2       | 1.8 GB       | 1 KB        | 1,800,000
```

Transform→GPU gets only 74 messages — but that's `4 GPUs × 18 prefetch`, more
than enough to keep GPUs busy. GPU→Sink gets millions because output is tiny.
**The byte budget naturally allocates more buffer where payloads are small.**

### 3.3 Adaptive Refinement (Runtime)

Startup estimates are rough (1KB/row). After the first few batches flow through,
the system refines bounds based on actual payload sizes:

```python
class AdaptiveQueueBound:
    def __init__(self, budget_bytes: int, min_pending: int):
        self._budget = budget_bytes
        self._min = min_pending
        self._avg_size_ema = 0.0
        self._samples = 0

    def observe(self, payload_bytes: int):
        """Called on each push. Updates exponential moving average."""
        self._samples += 1
        alpha = min(0.1, 2.0 / (self._samples + 1))
        self._avg_size_ema = alpha * payload_bytes + (1 - alpha) * self._avg_size_ema

    @property
    def max_pending(self) -> int:
        if self._avg_size_ema <= 0:
            return self._min * 10  # unknown size → conservative
        return max(int(self._budget / self._avg_size_ema), self._min)
```

After ~50 messages, the bound stabilizes. If payload sizes change mid-pipeline
(e.g., filter removes 90% of rows), the EMA adapts within ~20 messages.

### 3.4 Different Stage Types

The byte-budget approach automatically handles mixed workloads:

| Stage type | Typical payload | Effect |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Source → CPU transform | Large (raw data, 10-100MB) | Small max_pending (memory-limited) |
| CPU → GPU inference | Medium (preprocessed, 1-50MB) | Moderate max_pending |
| GPU → CPU postprocess | Small (embeddings, 1KB-1MB) | Large max_pending (count-limited by min_prefetch) |
| CPU → Sink | Small-medium | Large max_pending |

**No per-stage configuration needed.** The byte budget plus payload size
observation handles everything automatically.

### 3.2 Source Rate Control

Current source pushes all splits upfront (`plan_splits()` → push all). This
defeats bounded queues because all data enters the queue immediately.

**Change: source pushes incrementally, respecting queue bound.**

```python
# SourceManager (core/managers/source_manager.py)
class SourceManager:
    async def _produce_loop(self):
        for split in self._source.plan_splits():
            # Block until queue has room (natural backpressure)
            while self._queue_stats.pending_count >= self._max_pending:
                await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
                if self._should_stop:
                    return
            self._push_split(split)
```

This is equivalent to Flink's credit system: the queue bound IS the credit pool.

### 3.3 Worker Output Backpressure

Workers currently do unlimited `ack_and_scatter()`. With bounded downstream
queues, `ack_and_scatter` naturally blocks when downstream is full.

**Implementation: Anvil broker enforces the bound.**

```rust
// storage.rs — push_messages / ack_and_scatter
fn push_messages(&self, queue: &str, msgs: &[Message]) -> Result<()> {
    let counters = self.load_or_init_counters(queue).await?;
    let pending = counters.pending_count();

    if let Some(max) = self.get_queue_max_pending(queue) {
        if pending >= max {
            return Err(StorageError::QueueFull);
        }
    }
    // ... normal push
}
```

Python side: `StageWorker` catches `QueueFull`, waits, retries — no data loss.

---

## 4. Autoscaler Signal Changes

### 4.1 Problem with Queue Depth as Scaling Signal

With bounded queues, the source pushes until the queue is full, then blocks.
**Queue depth is always near `max_pending`** — it's no longer a useful scaling signal.

### 4.2 New Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `source_blocked_ratio` | % time source spends waiting for queue room | High → downstream bottleneck → scale UP downstream |
| `worker_idle_ratio` | % time workers spend waiting for data | High → downstream over-provisioned → scale DOWN |
| `processing_latency_p99` | Tail latency per batch | Rising → workers overloaded or data skew |

```python
# autoscaler.py
def _tick(self):
    # Replace queue_depth signal with supply/demand balance
    if self._source_blocked_ratio > 0.5:
        # Source is blocked >50% — downstream can't keep up
        self._scale_up(additive=self._compute_step())
    elif self._worker_idle_ratio > 0.5:
        # Workers idle >50% — too many workers
        self._scale_down(factor=0.5)
    # else: system in balance, hold
```

### 4.3 Compatibility with Existing AIMD

The existing AIMD structure (additive increase / multiplicative decrease,
asymmetric cooldowns) is correct. Only the input signal changes:

| Component | Keep | Change |
|-----------|------|--------|
| AIMD cooldowns (up=15s, down=60s) | ✅ | — |
| Eager fill at startup | ✅ | — |
| `_get_spawnable_count()` resource check | ✅ | — |
| `max_scale_step = 32` | ✅ | — |
| `scale_up_lag_threshold = 500` | ❌ | Replace with `source_blocked_ratio` |
| `scale_down_lag_threshold = 100` | ❌ | Replace with `worker_idle_ratio` |

### 4.4 Convergence (Analogous to TCP Slow Start)

```
Phase 1: Eager Fill (0-30s)
  Workers: min_parallelism → max_parallelism (fill fast)
  Source: pushes until queue bound hit
  Queue: fills to max_pending within seconds

Phase 2: Probe Bottleneck (30s-2min)
  source_blocked_ratio rises → downstream is bottleneck
  OR worker_idle_ratio rises → upstream is bottleneck
  Autoscaler adjusts worker count toward balance

Phase 3: Steady State (2min+)
  source_blocked_ratio ≈ 0.3 (source occasionally waits — normal)
  worker_idle_ratio ≈ 0.1 (workers occasionally wait — normal)
  GPU utilization: high (always has prefetched data)

Phase 4: Adaptive (continuous)
  Data characteristics change (e.g., larger records) →
  source_blocked_ratio shifts → autoscaler re-adjusts
```

---

## 5. Safety Net (Not Congestion Control)

Bounded queues handle normal operation. A thin safety net handles edge cases
that the bound can't prevent (e.g., a single payload that's 50GB, or a memory
leak in user operator code).

```python
class NodeHealthGuard:
    """Circuit breaker. Not a throttle — triggers only on imminent failure.

    If bounded queues are sized correctly, this never fires.
    Exists for defense-in-depth only.
    """

    MEMORY_FLOOR_MB = 1024    # 1 GB
    DISK_FLOOR_PCT = 0.05     # 5%

    def check(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Returns failure reason, or None if healthy."""
        import psutil

        mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
        if mem.available < self.MEMORY_FLOOR_MB * 1048576:
            return f"OOM imminent: {mem.available // 1048576}MB available"

        if self._nvme_path:
            disk = os.statvfs(self._nvme_path)
            if disk.f_bavail / disk.f_blocks < self.DISK_FLOOR_PCT:
                return f"Disk full: {disk.f_bavail / disk.f_blocks:.1%} remaining"

        return None
```

**StageMaster integration:**

```python
# stage_master.py monitor loop
health = self._health_guard.check()
if health:
    logger.critical(f"Node health critical: {health}")
    self._pause_source()
    # Also: nack all claimed messages so other nodes can process them
```

---

## 6. NvmeNodeService (Minimal)

The `_FlightServerActor` evolves into `NvmeNodeService` with exactly two jobs:

1. **Flight server subprocess** (existing — gRPC isolation from Ray)
2. **NodeHealthGuard** (new — disk + memory circuit breaker)

**No metrics reporting, no bandwidth monitoring, no resource tracking.**
Bounded queues make those unnecessary.

```python
class NvmeNodeService:
    """Per-node: Flight server + health guard. Job-level actor (not detached).

    Why job-level: code updates deploy automatically with new jobs.
    Flight subprocess persists via port binding (OS-level singleton).
    """

    def __init__(self, root_dirs, job_id):
        self._flight_port = self._ensure_flight_subprocess(root_dirs)
        self._health_guard = NodeHealthGuard(root_dirs[0])

    def get_flight_port(self) -> int:
        return self._flight_port

    def check_health(self) -> Optional[str]:
        return self._health_guard.check()

    def _ensure_flight_subprocess(self, root_dirs) -> int:
        """Start Flight subprocess if not already running (port binding = singleton)."""
        # Try connecting to existing subprocess on well-known port
        # If port in use → reuse. If free → start new subprocess.
        ...
```

---

## 7. Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowFlowConfig:
    buffer_memory_fraction: float = 0.4
    # Fraction of node memory for pipeline buffers.
    # Default 0.4 means: 40% buffers, 60% for workers + Ray + OS + GPU.
    # Increase to 0.5-0.6 for pipelines with many stages or large payloads.
    # Decrease to 0.2-0.3 for GPU-heavy pipelines (GPU memory needs more room).

    min_prefetch: int = 2
    # Minimum buffered messages per downstream worker.
    # Prevents GPU starvation even when memory budget is tight.
    # Increase to 4 for very fast GPU operators (< 100ms/batch).

# Usage:
job = Job(
    stages=[...],
    flow_config=WorkflowFlowConfig(),  # default works for most workloads
)
```

**Users configure zero to two parameters.** The system automatically:
1. Reads node memory at startup
2. Computes per-stage byte budgets (proportional to downstream workers)
3. Estimates initial max_pending from batch_size
4. Refines at runtime via payload size EMA

---

## 8. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Bounded Queue (P0)

**Goal: eliminate OOM / disk-full / network-saturation failures.**

| Task | File | Effort |
|------|------|--------|
| Add `max_pending` to QueueGroup metadata | `lib/anvil-rs/src/storage.rs` | S |
| `push_messages` returns `QueueFull` when at bound | `lib/anvil-rs/src/storage.rs` | S |

| Task | File | Effort |
|------|------|--------|
| Track `source_blocked_ratio` in SourceManager | `core/managers/source_manager.py` | S |
| Track `worker_idle_ratio` in WorkerManager | `core/managers/worker_manager.py` | S |

---

## 9. What This Deprecates

| Document | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `multi-resource-backpressure.md` | **Deprecated** | Wrong direction: monitoring N resource dimensions is complex and fragile. Bounded queues solve all resource problems implicitly. |
| `deprecated/partition-backpressure-improvements.md` | **Already deprecated** | Referenced old Tansu/Kafka model. |

| Code concept | Status | Reason |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| `JobBackpressureController` (queue-depth only) | **Replace** | Queue depth is meaningless with bounded queues. Replace with `source_blocked_ratio`. |
| `BackpressureSignal.PAUSE / RESUME` | **Extend** | Keep as circuit breaker, add `throttle_ratio` for proportional control. |
| Multi-resource monitors (MemoryMonitor, DiskMonitor, etc.) | **Don't build** | Bounded queues make them unnecessary. NodeHealthGuard is sufficient. |

## 10. What This Keeps

| Component | Why keep |
|-----------|---------|
| AIMD cooldowns (up=15s, down=60s) | Proven in production. Asymmetric = correct (GPUs expensive, fill fast). |
| Eager fill at startup | Critical for GPU utilization. New job should saturate GPUs within 30s. |
| `_get_spawnable_count()` resource check | Still needed: don't schedule workers that can't get CPU/GPU. |
| `RecoveryManager` with exponential backoff | Orthogonal to flow control. Keep as-is. |
| `max_scale_step = 32` | Allows filling a full GPU node in one step. |
| FlightServerProcess subprocess isolation | Required: Arrow Flight gRPC conflicts with Ray gRPC. |
| NVMe write policies (WRITE_THROUGH / WRITE_BACK) | Orthogonal to flow control. Keep as-is. |
| S3 auto-degrade on failure | Orthogonal. Keep as-is. |

---

## Appendix A: Why Not Multi-Dimensional Congestion Control

The `multi-resource-backpressure.md` proposal suggested monitoring memory, disk,
network, object store, and S3 — five dimensions with independent thresholds.

Problems with that approach:
1. **Threshold tuning**: What's the right memory threshold? 85%? 90%? Depends on
   workload, payload size, and operator memory usage. One size doesn't fit all.
2. **Latency**: By the time you measure OOM risk, it may be too late.
3. **Interaction effects**: High memory + high disk + moderate network — which
   threshold wins? Priority logic adds complexity.
4. **Irrelevance to GPU**: None of the 5 dimensions directly relate to GPU
   utilization, which is the primary optimization target.

Bounded queues solve all of these:
- No thresholds to tune (just `prefetch_factor`)
- Proactive (prevents overload, doesn't react to it)
- No interaction effects (one bound controls everything)
- GPU-centric (prefetch_factor sized for GPU consumption rate)

## Appendix B: Configuration Guide

### When to adjust `buffer_memory_fraction`

| Scenario | Adjust to | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Default (most pipelines) | 0.4 | Balanced: 40% buffers, 60% compute |
| Many stages (5+) or large payloads (>100MB) | 0.5-0.6 | More stages = more queues competing for memory |
| GPU-heavy (large models, high VRAM) | 0.2-0.3 | Leave room for GPU memory + CUDA context |
| CPU-only pipeline | 0.5 | No GPU memory pressure |

### When to adjust `min_prefetch`

| GPU operator speed | Recommended | Why |
|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| Slow (>5s/batch, LLM inference) | 2 (default) | Plenty of time to fill buffer |
| Medium (1-5s/batch, video encoding) | 2-3 | Default works |
| Fast (<1s/batch, image transforms) | 4 | GPU drains buffer quickly, need deeper prefetch |

### Multi-stage memory budget example

```
32GB node, buffer_fraction=0.4 → 12.8GB budget

Pipeline: Source → Resize(8w) → Embed[GPU](4w) → Dedup(4w) → Lance[Sink](2w)

Queue              | DS workers | Budget  | Payload  | max_pending | Effective prefetch
Source→Resize      | 8          | 5.7 GB  | 2 MB     | 2,850       | 356 per worker
Resize→Embed[GPU]  | 4          | 2.8 GB  | 10 MB    | 280         | 70 per GPU ✓
Embed→Dedup        | 4          | 2.8 GB  | 50 KB    | 56,000      | 14,000 per worker
Dedup→Lance        | 2          | 1.4 GB  | 50 KB    | 28,000      | 14,000 per worker

Total buffered: ≤ 12.8 GB (guaranteed by budget)
GPU prefetch: 70 batches (more than enough — GPU never starves)
```

Note: the GPU input queue (Resize→Embed) gets only 2.8GB but that's 280 messages
of 10MB each — 70 per GPU. Even if GPU processes 1 batch/sec, that's 70 seconds
of runway. The system is self-balancing without per-stage tuning.
